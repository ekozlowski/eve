Eve
===

This repository just contains the files from me playing around with the 
Eve framework for Python.  

Eve is available here: http://python-eve.org/

As usual, I'll probably be wrapping heaps of automation around it, so if
it seems complicated from a Python perspective, it's because I'm using
my DevOps tools on it.

Eve
===

This repository just contains the files from me playing around with the 
Eve framework for Python.  

Eve is available here: http://python-eve.org/

As usual, I'll probably be wrapping heaps of automation around it, so if
it seems complicated from a Python perspective, it's because I'm using
my DevOps tools on it.

Feel free to just poke at the Python source without installing all the
overhead of Vagrant, Ansible, and Virtualbox.

You Will Need
=============

- Vagrant (tested on 1.7.4)
- Ansible (tested on 1.9.2)
- Virtualbox (tested on 5.0.4)
